# C LINKED LIST

created date: 2023-09-08 02:18

Basically this whole project was done in one night just to have some experience with C pointers and memory addresses. It was fun to implement but I don't
recommend to read that code because it's a mess. I also have to compare that implementation to KNOWN to human implementations because I didn't use any example
or template. I'm not even sure if that is correct. That will be in my TODOS :) 


# TODOS
- [ ] Check if that code is even close to correct implementation
- [ ] If yes, check how it SHOULD be implemented
